* **A Call for Empirical Process Data Structures in OB and HRM Research and Practice (title of manuscript; opening statement section; we introduce the manuscript in this section)**
  + What do we use data for? (first paragraph)
  + What types of data do we typically collect and evaluate? (second paragraph)
  + What types of data do we fail to collect? (third paragraph)
  + What will readers learn from this manuscript? (fourth paragraph)
  
* **Typical Empirical Data Structures in OB and HRM Research and Practice (section; level 1 header; this section provides an overview of typical empirical data structures found in OB and HRM)**
  + Cross-Sectional Observational and Experimental Data (sub-section; level 2 header)
    + Multilevel Data (sub-section; level 3 header)
  + Panel Longitudinal (Repeated Measures) Data (sub-section; level 2 header)
    + Time Series Data (sub-section; level 3 header)
  
* **Empirical Process Data Structures (section; level 1 header; this section provides an overview of empirical process data structures)**
  + Definition (sub-section; level 2 header)
  + Comparisons (sub-section; level 2 header)
    + Focus on actions and work instead of aggregated and often perceptual and memory-based inputs, processes, and outputs
  + Benefits (sub-section; level 2 header)
    + Finer-grained representation of processes
    + Empirical study of self-organization and emergence
    + Mapping of nested time structures (strategies for a performance episode composing a project, a set of performance episodes composing a project, a set of projects)
    + Investigation of process strategies
  + Process Data Collection Technology
    + Already present for decades: e-mails, calendars, documents, chat messaging
    + Video recordings: virtual or live meetings
    + Databases of employee work activities
    + Sociometric badges
